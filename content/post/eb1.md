## Background

I have recently received my U.S. green card after successfully petitioning under the EB-1A category as an alien of extraordinary ability in sciences. 
I prepared and filed my petition without help of a law firm or attorney. I, however, learned and benefited from petition examples of other scientists that I found online and from a couple petitions shared with me by friends. I decided to also release my complete petition with the hope that it can be helpful for others who want to build their own applications.

I am originally from Russia where I also completed my undergraduate studies.

Administrative processing
Not able to travel
A friend successfully self-petitioned for EB2-NIW without lawyers before.


I am a Russian national with a PhD from EPFL in Switzerland. My research background is in data privacy and computer security. At the time of petitioning, I had just finished my third year of being a postdoc in the U.S., had five peer-reviewed publications, two of which as the first author, and around 300 citations. So, I had a reasonable but not an outstanding profile. The one thing that helped me to substantiate my petition was that a tiny piece of my prior work was used in iMessage and in Facebook Messenger. I heavily used this in my petition, _slightly_ exaggerating its impact.

The example that I relied on the most was by (Razvan Marinescu)[https://razvanmarinescu.github.io/green-card-I-140/] who had self-petitioned and got approved under the same category in 2021. Another useful example (for both EB-1 and EB2-NIW) is by Andrey Solovyev. Finally, the Oscar's Green Card Youtube channel is a useful resource to understand the basics of the petition process and hear testimonies of other people with approved DIY petitions.

Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer and none of the information here is a legal advice.

My perception is that you have either a sure-acceptance case or a complicated situation, then getting assistance from an attorney is useful and might cut down your preparation time. But if you are a scientist with a reasonable but not outstanding profile (basically like mine), you will have higher chances of getting approved by preparing the petition yourself.

## I-140

eight letters of support
Someone who actually knows your work but have not directly collaborated with you. Out of eight recommenders, two were my formers research advisors, four were university professors who knew me and my work a little bit (because we either met at a conference, I gave a talk at their seminar at some point, or I previously interviewed to work with them), and two were from applied scientists from a tech company that used my work in their product.

degree evaluations ($85 for evaluating three degrees)

### Structure

Start with the high-level impact of my work and relevance to the US.

Reviews in exhibits: an email with the invitation to join the PC or to provide an expert review, then screenshots for each review.
I was able to log in into every platform / venue I reviewed for and find a copy of my review.
I used GoFullPage browser extension to make screenshots of long reviews.



## I-485

Doctors: fidi but also options in astoria and flushing (if you are in nyc)

Translation: used Itrex ($10 for translating a USSR-issued birth certificate)
