## Background

I have recently received my U.S. green card after petitioning under the EB-1A category as an alien of extraordinary ability in sciences. The petitioning process was definitely convoluted, and I had to spend quite a bit of time navigating it. But I was able to prepare, file and get my petition approved by myself without hiring a lawyer.
The most helpful thing for understanding the process and getting started was reading petition examples of other researchers. There are, unfortunately, only a handful of those online. So I have decided to post my complete petition with the hope that it can be helpful to other people who would like to compile their application and petition by themselves.

I am originally from Russia where I completed my undergraduate studies. After doing my MS in Sweden and PhD in Switzerland, I moved to New York on a J1 visa to start my postdoc. I realized fairly quickly that I wanted to continue my life and career in the U.S. so I started looking into long-term immigration prospects. Also, being from Russia, I had been subject to administrative processing every time I had applied for a U.S. visa so, after my initial stamp had expired, I could not travel outside the country any more (administrative processing typically takes several months and my postdoc position did not have the flexibility of working for months from abroad) so I needed that green card even to be able to travel to conferences abroad.

I knew several people who were petitioning for a green card with the help of various law firms. I did a profile evaluation with a couple popular firms but I did not find them particularly convincing (but I did find them pricey!) At the same time, a friend of mine, also a postdoc but in a different field, prepared and got approved for EB2-NIW without lawyers so I knew that it was feasible. So I decided to explore the DYI path with the idea that I always could go back to lawyers if the task would turn out too hard. That is when I started studying any resources available online. The two examples online that helped me the most were the petitions and templates of Razvan Marinescu (2021) and of Andrey Solovyev (2012). I also found the Oscar's Green Card Youtube channel useful, especially interviews with other successful petitioners.

Other examples that I know of but have not used:

### Why EB-1A

I was initially looking into EB2-NIW as my profile was not outstanding---around 300 citations and 5 publications, two as the first author, although all the publications were in great venues in my field. But the backlog meant that, even if I was approved, I would be able to get the green card only in several years. 

but I quickly realized that the wait time for the priority date to become current was quite long (several years) and I would not be able to travel outside the U.S. during that time. So I decided to switch to EB-1A which has a much shorter wait time (currently, it is current for all countries). The downside of EB-1A is that it is a more demanding category and requires a stronger profile. But I thought that I had a reasonable chance of getting approved.

My research background is in data privacy and computer security. At the time of petitioning, I had just finished my third year of being a postdoc in the U.S., had five peer-reviewed publications, two of which as the first author, and around 300 citations. So, I had a reasonable but not an outstanding profile. The one thing that helped me to substantiate my petition was that a tiny piece of my prior work was used in iMessage and in Facebook Messenger. I heavily used this in my petition, _slightly_ exaggerating its impact.

The example that I relied on the most was by (Razvan Marinescu)[https://razvanmarinescu.github.io/green-card-I-140/] who had self-petitioned and got approved under the same category in 2021. Another useful example (for both EB-1 and EB2-NIW) is by Andrey Solovyev. Finally, the Oscar's Green Card Youtube channel is a useful resource to understand the basics of the petition process and hear testimonies of other people with approved DIY petitions.

**Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer and none of the information here is a legal advice.**

My perception is that you have either a sure-acceptance case or a complicated situation, then getting assistance from an attorney is useful and might cut down your preparation time. But if you are a scientist with a reasonable but not outstanding profile (basically like mine), you will have higher chances of getting approved by preparing the petition yourself.

## I-140

### Support letters

eight letters of support
Someone who actually knows your work but have not directly collaborated with you. Out of eight recommenders, two were my formers research advisors, four were university professors who knew me and my work a little bit (because we either met at a conference, I gave a talk at their seminar at some point, or I previously interviewed to work with them), and two were from applied scientists from a tech company that used my work in their product.
Arguably the most important. Law firms often suggest submitting without letters but frankly this is simply to save their effort and time because they try to just insert your details into their template and be done with it. The same with resubmitting after receiving RFE instead of responding to it---it is easier to resend the same petition and hope that a different officer will approve it instead on putting work into responding to the RFE.

degree evaluations ($85 for evaluating three degrees)

### Structure

Start with the high-level impact of my work and relevance to the US.

Reviews in exhibits: an email with the invitation to join the PC or to provide an expert review, then screenshots for each review.
I was able to log in into every platform / venue I reviewed for and find a copy of my review.
I used GoFullPage browser extension to make screenshots of long reviews.


### Payment
Separate forms for each fee
Payment by a credit card. Reddit insists on using checks but if you have a US credit card, you should be fine paying with it. Probably do not use Citi cards, they are notorious for randomly blocking transactions. I used my Amex card and later Capital One for I-485 and both worked without an issue.



## I-485

Doctors: fidi but also options in astoria and flushing (if you are in nyc)

Translation: used Itrex ($10 for translating a USSR-issued birth certificate)
