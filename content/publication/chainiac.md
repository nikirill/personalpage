abstract = """Software-update mechanisms are critical to the security of modern systems, but their typically centralized 
design presents a lucrative and frequently attacked target. In this work, we propose CHAINIAC, 
a decentralized software-update framework that eliminates single points of failure, enforces transparency, and 
provides efficient verifiability of integrity and authenticity for software-release processes. 
Independent witness servers collectively verify conformance of software updates to release policies, 
build verifiers validate the source-to-binary correspondence, and a tamper-proof release log stores 
collectively signed updates, thus ensuring that no release is accepted by clients before being widely disclosed and validated. 
The release log embodies a skipchain, a novel data structure, enabling arbitrarily out-of-date clients to efficiently 
validate updates and signing keys. Evaluation of our CHAINIAC prototype on reproducible Debian packages shows that 
the automated update process takes the average of 5 minutes per release for individual packages, and only 20 seconds 
for the aggregate timeline. We further evaluate the framework using real-world data from the PyPI package repository 
and show that it offers clients security comparable to verifying every single update themselves while consuming only 
one-fifth of the bandwidth and having a minimal computational overhead."""
