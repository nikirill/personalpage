# Bio

Hi, I am a second-year PhD student in the [Decentralized/Distributed Systems lab](https://dedis.ch/) at
[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL)](http://www.epfl.ch/index.en.html)
advised by Prof. [Bryan Ford](http://bford.info/).
My research interests lie in the areas of System and Network Security, Cryptographic Protocols and Distributed Systems.
I am currently focused on improving security of software update systems and building a secure peer-to-peer collaboration
platform.
