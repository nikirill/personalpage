# Bio

Hi, I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the [Decentralized and Distributed Systems lab](https://dedis.epfl.ch/) at
[École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](http://www.epfl.ch/index.en.html)
advised by Prof. [Bryan Ford](http://bford.info/), and a member of [IC3, The Initiative For CryptoCurrencies & Contracts](https://www.initc3.org/).
My research interests revolve around the topics in Privacy, Computer and Network Security, Distributed Systems, and Blockchain Smart Contracts.
I am currently focused on reducing metadata leakage from encrypted data formats and protocols for secure communication, 
improving security of software-update systems, and scaling and securing smart contracts.
