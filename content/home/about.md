# About

Hi, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University and the New York Genome Center working with 
Prof.&nbsp;[Gamze G&uuml;rsoy](https://www.nygenome.org/people/gamze-gursoy-phd/) on building solutions for 
privacy-preserving sharing and analysis of genomics data.
Previously, I completed my PhD in Computer and Communication Sciences at [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch/index.en.html), 
where I was advised by Prof.&nbsp;[Bryan Ford](http://bford.info/), 
and worked as a postdoc with Prof.&nbsp;[Vitaly Shmatikov](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~shmat/) at Cornell Tech.
My research interests revolve around topics in Privacy, Anonymity, Computer Security, and Genomics.
My past projects include work on reducing metadata leakage in network communication and encrypted data,
building robust systems for private information retrieval, improving the security of 
software-update systems, and scaling and securing smart contracts.
